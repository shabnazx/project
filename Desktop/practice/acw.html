<div class="blog2"> <header role="banner"> <h1> Building My Portfolio
Website</h1> </header> <p> Firstly, before building my website, I have
researched to see what types of designs I liked within a website. I have
collected these design ideas onto a mood board to give me an idea of
what type of things I would like to put onto my websites and make. </p>
<div class="boxes">                          <!--the links for the
images --> <div class="box6">         <!--this class will help target
the images from the css--> <img src="images/mood.jpg" alt="mood board"  
/>                <!--these are used for the flex boxes-->


	</div>


	<div class="box7"> <img src="images/wire.jpg" alt="website
	wireframe"  /> </div>


	<div class="box8"> <img src="images/colour.jpg" alt="colour scheme" 
	/>

	</div> <p> After this, I have decided to design and sketch my
	website onto azure to plan where to put my navigation and content.
	It is important to plan and design your website first as you will
	have an idea where to put different content. Azure helped me create
	a wireframe for my website, as I will have an idea of the type of
	content I will need to put together. I have created my own image
	banner to put onto my website. I created it on Photoshop where I
	used brush tools and different effects to create the image. </p>

<p> While doing this I also decided to put together a style sheet. The
style sheet is the type of colours, fonts and images you are going to
use onto the website. To help me create my style sheet I used <a
href="https://frontify.com/styleguide#examples"
title="frontify">frontify</a> and coolers website. The <a
href="https://coolors.co/" title="coolers">coolers</a> website helped
me pick out a colour scheme for my website. I have chosen my fonts from
google fonts to make the content appear better and the colours will
enhance the appearance of my website as it is bright and bold. </p>

<p> For my website, I made a simple navigation that is placed at the top
of the page. I have decided not to create a hamburger menu this is
because the user will want to see information straight away for example
a user would want to go onto a website and scan the page to find the
information they want.  A hamburger menu hides information from the
user: ‘A small three-bar icon tucked in the corner of a website. It has
no information scent. Even after the user has exhausted every other
option, it still might not occur to them that the answers they seek are
hiding behind those three bars. Users generally aren’t inclined to click
It.’, (Archer, 2016: <a href="http://jamesarcher.me/hamburger-menu"
title="james archer">online</a> ).  They will not discover certain areas
of the website therefore the user is likely to leave the website. I
Think by hiding the information in the hamburger menu it will restrict
the user from looking around. For my navigation I have used display
inline-flex this help ensure that each navigation section have an equal
amount of space. Also for the navigation bar I kept it small so that it
doesn’t take huge amount of space on the website. I have placed social
media icons inside my footer and I have chosen similar colours to match
my website. </p>

<p> I also created skip links for my website this is because I wanted to
ensure that my website is accessible however, the skip links are hidden
so that only people with accessible problems can use them. </p>

<p> To make the content on my website responsive I have used Flexboxes.
The flexboxes is useful for the pictures. This is because when the
website is resized for a smaller screen, the image will stack underneath
each other with even amount of space. I have also put text inside the
flexboxes so it will fit page even if it is resized. ‘By default, each
grid cell is the same width and height as every other cell in the row.
They all size to fit by default. ‘, (Walton, 2016:<a
href="https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/grids/"
title="walton">online</a>) I also used media queries to make my website
responsive. The media queries are used to rescale the content so it fits
a phone tablet and desktop. For the desktop the page is put onto a
container so that it doesn’t over a maximum width but it can rescaled to
a smaller size. </p>
