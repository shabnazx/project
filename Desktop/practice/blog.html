     <h1> Is The Web Industry For Females?  </h1>
	 </header>
	 
	

<p>Are you looking to pursue your career in the web development industry? “Well I have good news for you!” there are many opportunities that you can go in, either the developers role, UX or a project manager. According to the Digital skills conference The developers role is the hardest to fill in, scoring a massive 65% compared to sales, business development, and project manager.  Therefore, there are more opportunities than you realise. 
“Ladies don’t panic!”
According to the results of the survey, the technical roles have a gender split of 70% for male and only 30% for female. This means that for you women out there, you have better opportunities of getting into web development as the industry is trying to lower the gender split. 

 </p>

<p>The digital industry is developing every year according to  <a href="http://www.techcityuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Tech-Nation-2016_FINAL-ONLINE-1.pdf?utm_content=buffer2e58f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">Tech Nation</a> it has seen a growth of 32% in digital turnover between 2010 and 2014. 
We see new technologies coming out each year and there is always a demand for more web developers and project managers. I think females have the right creativity skills and this will help them get job in the industry. Women are not shy to show their creative side from either showing it from photography or maybe in their project managing. One of the main reasons that women are reluctant to work in the digital industry might because they might have fear of being isolated. According to the article, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3008216/the-loneliness-of-the-female-coder" title="loneliness of the female blogger"> The Loneliness of the Female Coder </a> The blogger described how she felt while working in the industry.  ‘the boss who told colleagues that I was "too smart for my own good" and never gave me credit for my work, the subordinate who did everything possible to undermine my authority because he hated working for a woman, the team who would go to the pub together and never invite me, and that was hard to deal with.’ (Byrne, 2013: online)

<p>The industry should not just hire one female coder but many others as well there should be an equal balance so that everyone can interact. The article portrays that there has been female coders and project managers working and doing well but they end up leaving because the ratio of males is higher than the females. Due to this ratio, the men do not adapt well when women are introduced into the workplace. Women should start thinking about having a career within the industry as they have the same capabilities as the men.
In the future, I think there are many opportunities for me in the project manager industry due to the skills set that I already have. I think the project manager role is best suited to me as I have the planning and organisational skills.
